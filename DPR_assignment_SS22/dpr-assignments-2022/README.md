# DPR Assignments
If you're new to Python you might want to do a Python tutorial first. For NumPy and scikit-learn, have a look at https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/index.html and https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html, respectively.

## Python installation
You can download the newest version of Python https://www.python.org/downloads/. For Windows, download the Windows installer. Many Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu, already come with Python, so there is no need for an installation.

### Installing Python packages
Using pip is the recommended way to install additional Python packages. We provide a requirements.txt file within our git repository, so you can simply execute `pip3 install -r /path/to/requirements.txt` to install all required packages.

### Virtual environments
A virtual environment is a tool that helps to keep dependencies required by different projects separate by creating isolated python virtual environments for them. This is not required for the programming assignments, but in case you're working on other python projects as well, this might be interesting for you.

There are many different solutions for managing virtual environments, we want to mention three different ones here.

- https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual (recommended for Windows)
- virtualenv: Simply execute pip3 install virtualenv to install it.
- https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv (even allows multiple versions of Python at a time) with https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv
